    <p>Unfalse Engine is a game engine made with C & C++ by two students from the 3rd grade of Design and Development of Videogames, from the CITM UPC (Terrassa). Marc Palma & Pol Juan were the responsibles to make this project come true. Our project is split in two parts, where the first and second assignments were programmed in the original engine <a href="https://github.com/Sauko22/Unfalse-Engine">Unfalse Engine</a>. But unfortunately, we had to fork from the engine of <a href="https://github.com/marcpages2020/GenesisEngine">Marc Pagès</a> to make the third and last assignment.  </p>

     <h2>Main Core Sub-system</h2>
     <h4>GameObject and Components</h4>
     Game Objects can be imported and added from the assets folder. Can also create empty game objects, which can be modificate by clicking them on the hierachy.<br/>
     Every game object has components that are shown in the inspector window. Components such as: Transformation (position, rotation and scale) which determinates their position      in the world, Mesh, Texture, Camera Component and Animation.<br/>
     
     <h4>Resource Manager</h4>
      System created in order to manage all custom file formats. With this manager you control the import, save and load of all game info (meshes, textures, models...).
      In-game, this manager allows the user to use everything using only the custom files from library and ignoring the assets files, increasing the speed and performance.
      
     <h4>Scene Management</h4>
      The scene which all the assets are in can be save and load at any time. If the file is not new, it will replace the old one.<br/>
      
     <h4>Custom File</h4>
      To decrease the waiting time of load and save of files, this engine uses an original and unique file.<br/>
      
    
    <h2>Skeletal Animation</h2> 
     Read the animation from the model and reproduces it in the engine. It generate a skeleton, that moves all vertices acordingly generating real time animations.
